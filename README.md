## The core idea: use consistency regularity to extract valid signals from unlabeled data.

The consistency regularity expresses the designer’s a priori to the model that the network should be flat in the vicinity of the input data. Even if the input data changes slightly, the output of the model can remain basically unchanged. (Play a similar role, add noise, data enhancement, dropout, prevent model overfitting, learn more robust features)
